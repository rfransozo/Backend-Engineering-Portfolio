# Backend Engineering Portfolio

Senior Python backend engineer focused on building scalable, cloud-ready systems with strong data and architecture foundations.

This repository serves as an entry point to my work, highlighting projects that simulate real-world backend systems, infrastructure, and data workflows.

---

## How to navigate this portfolio

Each repository focuses on a specific responsibility commonly found in production environments:

- Backend systems: business logic, APIs, and architecture
- Cloud infrastructure: deployment, security, and scalability
- CI/CD: automation and operational reliability
- Data pipelines: analytics and business insights
- Applied AI: pragmatic use of LLMs in backend services

The projects are intentionally connected and designed to reflect how systems evolve in real teams.

## Core Projects

### Backend Platform
**Repository:** [python-subscription-platform](https://github.com/rfransozo/python-subscription-platform)

Production-grade Python backend for subscription billing, order management, and access control.

What it demonstrates:
- Clean architecture and domain-driven design (light)
- Business-oriented modeling (not CRUD-only)
- Authentication, authorization, and idempotent workflows

---

### Cloud Infrastructure
**Repository:** [aws-python-backend-infra](https://github.com/rfransozo/aws-python-backend-infra)

AWS infrastructure as code for running Python backend services in a production-like environment.

What it demonstrates:
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Secure networking and IAM design
- Cost-aware and scalable cloud architecture

---

### CI/CD Automation
**Repository:** [python-backend-cicd](https://github.com/rfransozo/python-backend-cicd)

CI/CD pipelines for Python backend services using GitHub Actions.

What it demonstrates:
- Automated testing and validation
- Container build and deployment workflows
- Safe and maintainable pipeline design

---

### Data and Analytics
**Repository:** [python-data-analytics-pipeline](https://github.com/rfransozo/python-data-analytics-pipeline)

Data pipeline transforming transactional backend data into analytical models and business metrics.

What it demonstrates:
- ETL design and data modeling
- Business metric definitions (MRR, churn, LTV)
- Bridging backend systems with analytics needs

---

### Applied AI
**Repository:** [llm-support-assistant-backend](https://github.com/rfransozo/llm-support-assistant-backend)

Backend service integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for customer support use cases.

What it demonstrates:
- Pragmatic LLM integration
- Cost and latency considerations
- Robust fallback strategies

---

## Design Philosophy

Across all projects, I prioritize:
- Clear ownership of responsibilities
- Explicit trade-offs and non-goals
- Simplicity over premature complexity
- Systems that can realistically be operated in production

These repositories are not tutorials. They are deliberate simulations of real engineering problems.

---

## Notes

- Projects evolve incrementally to reflect real development cycles
- Documentation focuses on why decisions were made, not just how
- Some integrations are intentionally mocked to keep scope realistic
